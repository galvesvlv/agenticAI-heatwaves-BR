# Shapefile Requirements

The `BR_UF_2024/` directory must contain the official Brazilian state boundaries provided by IBGE.

Required files:

- `BR_UF_2024.shp`  
- Associated auxiliary shapefile components (`.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`, `.cpg`)

These files represent the official 2024 state-level administrative boundaries from IBGE and are required for spatial operations within the project.
